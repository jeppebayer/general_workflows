The 'general_workflows' directory is to contain workflows of broad usability within the centre.
Each workflow in this direcory should made constructed in such a way that is easy for any user (more or less) to configure and run.
Workflows which are specific to the projects of single person or few people should not be placed here.
It is a good idea to make each workflow as self-contained as possible to reduce dependencies.

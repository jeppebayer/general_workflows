## Under development
  # make 2d sfs, potentially based on Jilongs gwf workflow
  # I wrote it as a gwf workflow in /home/jilong/EcoGenetics/people/jilong/jb_2dsfs/scripts/workflow.py
    #Here is a step-by-step process
    # 1: copy the whole folder /home/jilong/EcoGenetics/people/jilong/jb_2dsfs
    # 2: change the root_path setting in workflow.py , which should be YOUR_PATH/jb_2dsfs
    # 3: cd YOUR_PATH/jb_2dsfs/scripts 
    # 4: gwf config set backend slurm (only for the first time usage of gwf in this folder)
    # 5: gwf run , if this workflow runs for the first time, this will only submit the data_prepare job
    # 6: gwf run , run this workflow again after data preparation, 2dsfs will be done for each pair.
    
  # It's not fully automated yet in some sense because I induce a "data_prepare" step which generates a tab split txt file containing all the contrasting pairs first for the input vcf. Then you can run all pairs automatically.Basically, the script needs to be run twice. (edited) 
  # All the results for the 2dsfs are in the folder /home/jilong/EcoGenetics/people/jilong/jb_2dsfs/steps/2dsfs/{pair_id}
  # I am not sure if you want the student to run the script as a practice for oneself or just use the results.
  # The script assumes a single vcf input containing multiple populations, which can easily take any other vcf file, generate the list of pairs (first time running) and run 2dsfs for each pair (second time running). (edited)
